learn-cryptography
==================

This is an AppEngine app for learning basic crytography through analysing and
decrypting a series of texts. It's designed as a game targeted at high school
students.

The live game will be available at learn-cryptography.appspot.com when ready
enough for public use (i.e. not yet).

To set up your own development version follow instructions at:
https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads to install the Google App
Engine SDK for Python. You will need Python 2.7.

Install Bower (bower.io) or nodejs (nodejs.org) which will install bower for
you. Then, in the top level learn-cryptography directory run:

npm install 
OR
bower install

This will fill out the necessary dependencies in the client/bower_components
directory used by the app. Run the AppEngine app with the local dev appserver.
